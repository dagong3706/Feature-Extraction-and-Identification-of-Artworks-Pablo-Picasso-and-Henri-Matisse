## Abstract 

For this homework, we are analyzing artworks from Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, especially from 1900 to 1942. The dataset we are going to use is from two websites (https://www.pablo-ruiz-picasso.net/topviews.php, http://www.henri-matisse.net/paintingssectionone.html). These two artists shared quite a few similarities in their works after their first meeting in 1906, therefore our research question is Whether this Meeting Significantly Influenced Their Styles in Artworks. We believe that since their meeting, Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse started to influence each other. 

Our hypothesis is that the similarities between their artworks grow after their meeting. We are going to use Complexity scores, including color, variance, entropy and etc, as features to compare and predict the pictures of the two artists. We will be using jupyter notebook, Python, openCV to extract the features. For visualization, we choose Interactive Plots and Matplotlib charts to show our analysis of the similarities. In class, we learned web scraping and basic image features. In the project, we will use the same web scraping skills to acquire data, but, as the expansion, we will be using advanced image features such as self-defined complex scores to compare the artwork of two artists. Furthermore, we will be using Bayes classifier to predict and classify paintings of these two artists based on features and complexity scores we defined. 

We were always fascinated by the rivalry between artists. The rivalry was like a catalyst; it created tension, ignited each otherâ€™s creativity, and inspired each other through the process of creation. We are particularly interested in discovering the similarities of artworks of Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, two stars whose light shined through the history of modern art. Picasso once said, "If I were not making the paintings I make, I would paint like Matisse," and Matisse said much the same about Picasso. In the following decades, these two had an interesting relationship: they cherished each other, yet were in rivalry with each other. From time to time, their paintings were put together side by side and commented on. When Matisse created a sensational painting, Picasso would create one as a response. I believe studying the similarity of artworks between these two would give us an insight not only in their relationship but in the development of modern art as well.


## Data

(10 points) 

This section will describe your data and its origins. Each item should contain a name of the data source, a link to the source, and any necessary background information such as:
- What is your cultural data source? 
- When was it made? 
- Who created the works? 
- Is it digital native, or is it some kind of scan, recording, photo, etc., of an analog form? 

## Code

(20 points)

This section will link to the various code for your project (stored within this repository). Your code should be executable on datahub, should we choose to replicate your result. This includes code for: 

- data acquisition/scraping
- cleaning
- analysis
- generating results. 

Link each of your notebooks or .py files within this section, and provide a brief explanation of what the code does. Reading this section we should have a sense of how to run your code.

## Results

(30 points) 

This section will contain links to documentation of your results. This can include figures, sound files, videos, bitmaps, as appropriate to your domain of analysis. Each result should include a brief textual description, and all should be listed below: 

- image files (`.jpg`, `.png` or whatever else is appropriate)
- audio files (`.wav`, `.mp3`)
- written text as `.pdf`

## Discussion

(30 points, three to five paragraphs)

The first paragraph should be a short summary describing your results.

The subsequent paragraphs could address questions including:
- Why is this culturally relevant?
- How does your computational approach differ from the traditional art historical, musicological, manuel/subjective approach to analyzing your cultural subject? 
- How do you think the original artists/musicians would respond to this type of analysis? Would it change/inform their practice in some way?
- How do your results relate to broader social, cultural, economic political, etc., issues? 
- In what future directions could you expand this work?

## Team Roles

Provide an account of individual members and their efforts/contributions to the specific tasks you accomplished.

## Technical Notes and Dependencies

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Additional libraries you are using for this project
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does this code need to run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
